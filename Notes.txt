Things to add / include:

# to Look up
- How to display splash screen on page loag
  Will give "how to" for different features and allow (force) selection of grid size
= If you add splash screen, add an 'Instructions' button that re-pops-up the splashscreen


# Programmatic structure
- Add pop-up text over pencil and eraser icons


# Adding color
-RGB: 3 text fields &/or 3 dials to choose RGB values. Have picture next to dials which show the 
color chosen.
- A 'histories' series of boxes, which show the ~5 most recently used colors. Clicking on a box will select the given color
- A selection of ~12 common colors
= Both of above should update RGB fields and picture with appropriate numbers


# Other
- Add text somewhere (eg, lower-right corner) showing dimensions of currently selected grid (eg, 25x25)
- Place a div down right side of header/grid. Could be where (eg) color options are stored
