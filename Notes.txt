Things to add / include:

# to Look up
- How to display splash screen on page loag
  Will give "how to" for different features and allow (force) selection of grid size


# Programmatic structure
- Create global variable holding either (a) all rows + squares, or (b) all squares
- Add pop-up text over pencil and eraser icons
- Change 'drawing mode' to be activated by 'click'


# Adding color
-RGB: 3 text fields &/or 3 dials to choose RGB values. Have picture next to dials which show the 
color chosen.
- A 'histories' series of boxes, which show the ~5 most recently used colors. Clicking on a box will select the given color
- A selection of ~12 common colors
= Both of above should update RGB fields and picture with appropriate numbers


# Buttons, toggles, etc
- Button to change from 'drawing mode' to 'erase mode'


# Other
- Add text somewhere (eg, lower-right corner) showing dimensions of currently selected grid (eg, 25x25)
- Place a div down right side of header/grid. Could be where (eg) color options are stored


# Fixes & Bugs
- "Create Grid!" button: If user clicks 'Cancel', this should not prompt pop-up of "Please enter a number between..."
